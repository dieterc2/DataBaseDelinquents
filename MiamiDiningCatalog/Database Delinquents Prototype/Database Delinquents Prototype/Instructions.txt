This is made the same as in Lab 4. 

You first link your directory for the directory containing the files Project.java, Project.class, Project.db and sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar.
You run the Project.java using javac Project.java
You then type java -classpath ".;sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar" Project

Then the program should start asking you what you want to query.
Typing help will list your options in the beginning.
Other options currently include to type in include dh, hours, buffet and admin.

note admin is not listed in help because it would not be listed in a usual system like this.
the username is 'big cheese' and password is 'password'
if you follow this route you will be allowed to enter information for a new dining hall.

if you chose anything else it will query the database and show you what you want.

Overall
Just follow instructions and continue to the end.

To exit just close command line or type ctrl c
